The p-value 
is defined as the best (largest) probability, under the null hypothesis 
H about the unknown distribution F of the test statistic X, to have observed a value as 
extreme or more extreme than the value actually observed. 

If the p-value is very small,then the statistical significance is thought to be very large

Invariant and Evaluation Metric
To recap, an invariant metric is an objective measure that you should expect will not vary 
between conditions and that indicate equivalence between groups. Evaluation metrics, on the 
other hand, represent measures where you expect there will be differences between groups, and 
whose differences should say something meaningful about your experimental manipulation.
